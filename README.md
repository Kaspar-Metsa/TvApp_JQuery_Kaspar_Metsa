This is a TTU university project completed by me - a web app for tracking TV series that you have watched using only JQuery, HTML and CSS.

Please test the web application here: http://dijkstra.cs.ttu.ee/~Kaspar.Metsa/Kasutajaliidesed

Requirements for the TV app: (all these features are working)
==============
* Works offline with cache manifest and localstorage
* The app looks good on mobile
* The app uses API from http://api.themoviedb.org to get all the TV series data
